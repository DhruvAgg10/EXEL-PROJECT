# Calorie Tracker (Excel-Based)
This project is an **Excel-based Calorie Tracker** that allows users to track their daily nutrient intake efficiently.  

## Features:
âœ… Users can **choose food items** from an existing diet in **Sheet1** or enter their **custom diet**.  
âœ… **Dropdown selection** in **Sheet2** for quick meal logging.  
âœ… **VLOOKUP formulas** auto-fill **Protein, Carbs, Fats, and Calories**.  
âœ… **SUMIF formula** dynamically calculates total intake while ignoring errors.  
âœ… **Bar chart visualization** provides a clear overview of daily nutrient consumption.  

## How It Works:
1. **Sheet1:**  
   - Contains a pre-defined food list with nutritional values.  
   - Users can add custom food items along with their protein, carbs, fats, and calorie values.  

2. **Sheet2:**  
   - Users select food items from a **dropdown list**.  
   - Corresponding nutritional values auto-fill based on the selection.  
   - A **bar chart** dynamically updates to visualize daily intake.  

## Technologies Used:
- **Microsoft Excel**
- **VLOOKUP, SUMIF, and Data Validation (Dropdowns)**
- **Data Visualization using Excel Charts**

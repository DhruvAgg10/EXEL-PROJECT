# 📊 Excel VBA Yearly Report Automation

## Overview

This project automates the process of cleaning, formatting, summarizing, and consolidating monthly data across multiple worksheets in Excel using **VBA macros**.

Instead of manually handling data for each division, this script creates a unified **"Yearly Report"** sheet by:
- Adding headers to each worksheet (if missing)
- Formatting the sheets uniformly
- Auto-calculating totals per division
- Consolidating all cleaned data into a single summary sheet

## 🔧 Features

- 🧼 **Macro1**: Inserts headers like "Division", "Category", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar", and "Total"
- 🎨 **Macro2**: Formats headers with styles, alignment, bold fonts, and colors
- ➕ **AutoADD**: Calculates and inserts SUM formulas in the "Total" column
- 🔁 **YearlyReport Subroutine**:
  - Loops through each worksheet
  - Formats them (if not already formatted)
  - Copies cleaned data into the "Yearly Report" worksheet without duplication
- 🌀 Additional subroutines for modular tasks (`Sumforeachworksheet`, `Loopforeachworksheet`)

## 📁 File Structure

- `YearlyReport` - Main subroutine to consolidate and format all data
- `Macro1` - Adds standard headers
- `Macro2` - Applies formatting and styling
- `AutoADD` - Calculates totals in the "Total" column
- `Sumforeachworksheet` - Applies total calculation across all sheets
- `Loopforeachworksheet` - Applies formatting across all sheets

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Loop through all worksheets in the workbook.
2. Skip the "Yearly Report" sheet to prevent duplicate data.
3. If the headers are missing, insert and format them.
4. Calculate totals dynamically under the “Total” column.
5. Select all valid data rows and paste them into the "Yearly Report" sheet.
6. Apply final formatting and total summation on the consolidated sheet.

## 📈 Output

A clean, well-formatted "Yearly Report" that looks like this:

| Division | Category | Jan | Feb | Mar | Total |
|----------|----------|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| East     | Product A| ... | ... | ... |  ...  |
| West     | Product B| ... | ... | ... |  ...  |
| ...      | ...      | ... | ... | ... |  ...  |

## 🛠 Requirements

- Microsoft Excel (with macro support enabled)
- VBA Editor (Alt + F11 inside Excel)

## 📌 To Use

1. Open your Excel workbook with multiple division worksheets.
2. Press `Alt + F11` to open the VBA editor.
3. Copy all macros into a new module.
4. Run the `YearlyReport` subroutine.
5. Done! Your summary sheet is now ready.
